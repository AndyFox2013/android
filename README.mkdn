JellyBeer
===========

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/JellyBeer, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the CyanogenMod trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/AndyFox2013/android.git -b cm-10.1

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

And to start building:

    ./jb-build.sh DEVICE_NAME

Or if you want to sync and build:

    ./jb-build.sh DEVICE_NAME true
